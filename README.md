problem1:
Write a Python function that finds and prints all the prime numbers, pn, that
satisfy the following equation:
pn=(2**k) + (3**l)
for some non-negative integers k,l, such that k≤16, l≤16.

problem2:
A permutation of a list is a list that has all the same elements but possibly in a
different order. Write a Python function that takes two lists as input arguments
and checks whether the two lists are permutations of each other. If they are
permutations, the function returns True; otherwise, the function returns the total
number of different elements in the lists (repetitions are treated as separate
elements).
Ex: [10, 9, 11, 1] and [9,1,11,10] are permutations
[10, 9, 1, 10] and [8,1,11,10] are NOT permutations; no. of differences = 4

problem3:
Write a Python function, named “find_fibonacci”, which accepts a list as input. The function will find and return the elements that satisfy the Fibonacci property:  
a(k+2) = a(k) + a(k+1)
Example : Input list : [2, 8, 4, 6, 1, 7, 8, 4, 7, 9, 4, 13] Returned list : [[6,1,7], [1,7,8], [9,4,13]]
