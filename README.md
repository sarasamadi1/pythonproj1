# pythonproj1

problem1:
Write a Python function that finds and prints all the prime numbers, pn, that
satisfy the following equation:
pn=(2**k) + (3**l)
for some non-negative integers k,l, such that k≤16, l≤16.

problem3:
Write a Python function, named “find_fibonacci”, which accepts a list as input. The function will find and return the elements that satisfy the Fibonacci property:  
a(k+2) = a(k) + a(k+1)
Example : Input list : [2, 8, 4, 6, 1, 7, 8, 4, 7, 9, 4, 13] Returned list : [[6,1,7], [1,7,8], [9,4,13]]
